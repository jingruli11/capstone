    "This notebook analyzes the NYC taxi trips data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis questions:\n",
    "1.\tHow would you assess the efficiency of aggregating rides within Astoria? From Astoria to Manhattan? From Manhattan to Astoria?\n",
    "2.\tHow does this compare to our current area of service (e.g. the Upper East Side)?\n",
    "3.\tWould you provide rides only within Astoria for this new service or also between Astoria and Manhattan? Why? For reference, Via started as a commuter service between the Upper East Side and Midtown.\n",
    "4.\tWould you launch Astoria service during all our hours of operation (24/7) or only for certain hours? If so - which hours?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Statistical questions \n",
    "\n",
    "*answer these theoretically, no need to implement:*\n",
    "\n",
    "5.\tIf you were given a metric for efficiency (assume you don't know how it's calculated), how would you determine whether a specific zone is more efficient than the rest of the city? How would you determine why itâ€™s more efficient?\n",
    "6.\t How would you compare the distributions of intra-city trip prices between two different cities? How would you test whether any differences you find are explained by distance and duration?\n",
